**Directions to use**
- As of right now, if you want to find a specific configuration, you will need to type the exact name of the
configuration you are looking for. This is usually PCxxxx or something similar. 
- Alternatively, you can also search for a property. For instance, searching "Gabriel" will give you all the
configurations that were made from the Gabriel tessellation. Similarly, searching "2D" will give you
2D configurations or "100" will give you configurations with 100 nodes.
- The following configurations currently cannot be downloaded, but this will be fixed soon: 
PC20002, PC10001a, PC10001b , PC032525PoiD, PC032525PoiV, PC032525PoiC, PC032525PoiG
